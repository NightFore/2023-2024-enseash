# Synthesis Practical Work 1 - Ensea in the Shell

## Introduction
**Objectives :** This project involves the creation of a tiny shell in C language, displaying exit codes and execution times of launched programs

## Functionalities
- Display a welcome message followed by a simple prompt
- Execution of the entered command and return to the prompt
- Management of the shell output with the command `exit` or with `<ctrl>+d`
- Display the return code/signal and execution time of the previous command in the prompt
- Execution of complex commands (with arguments)
- Management of redirections to `stdin` and `stdout` with `'<'` and `'>'`
- Management of pipe redirection with `'|'`
- Return to the prompt immediatly with `'&'` (execution of programs in the background)

## Project Structure
- 'TP1_**question number and description**/' : Contain the .c file and the executing program
'''

## Operationg Instructions
1. Clone this repository on your machine
2. Place yourself in the right directory
3. If the executing program is missing or not compatible :
   - Compile the program (with gcc for example) :
'''bash
gcc program_name.c -o executing_program_name
'''
   - Execute program :
'''bash
./executing_program_name
'''
